# sql-challenge
module 9 Challenge
This challenge was to create tables in SQL from csv files to combine, alter, and extract certain data points and information.
the information used was for employees using their employee number, tittle id, first name, last name, department, title, along with
department id and title id.

I did encounter several issues with the Admin4 server, only allowing a certain amount of data to be shown in the Data Output, therefore
I did have to set a limit of 80,000 for it was the highest number of output that would not show an error.  I also lost connection to the
sever several times at the beggining not saving the creation of the tables and their constraints.  The tables were imported through the
import/export, however the constraints were saved and I coppied all to an sql file to show each Primary Key, Foreign Key, and alteration
of a collumn.

In conclusion, all query code functioned succesfully and all Keys were assigned apporietly and no errors were given when extracting
the information needed to complete this challenge.
