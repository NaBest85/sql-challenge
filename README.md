# sql-challenge
module 9 Challenge


This challenge was to create tables in SQL from csv files to combine, alter, and extract certain data points and information. The information used was for employees using their employee number, tittle id, first name, last name, department, title, along with department id and title id.
I did encounter several issues with the Admin4 server, only allowing a certain amount of data to be shown in the Data Output, therefore I did have to set a limit of 80,000 for it was the highest number of outputs that would not show an error. I also lost connection to the server several times at the beginning, not saving the creation of the tables and their constraints. The tables were imported through the import/export; however, the constraints were saved, and I copied them all to an SQL file to show each Primary Key, Foreign Key, and alteration of a column.
In conclusion, all query code functioned successfully, and all Keys were assigned appropriately, and no errors were given when extracting the information needed to complete this challenge.
